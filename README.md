Basic-Encrypter:
Basic-Encrypter is a simple Python script that encodes letters into numbers.

For ex-
a -> 1
b -> 2
c -> 3
.
.
.
z -> 26

Current Status:

This is an early version.
The script currently saves the output to a predefined file path (hardcoded inside the script).
It is not yet packaged, so it only works properly on my system.
